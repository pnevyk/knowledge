# Knowledge

This is my personal collection of resources writing about different fields of computer science and programming. Many of them I haven't read yet so I don't know if they're good or bad. Once I read them I will decide whether they should stay or not. The resources can be articles, blog posts, presentations, papers or whatever form human can impart knowledge.

The list of resources has no particular order, their place has been determined by time I has added them in.

## Sections

* [Programming languages and compilers/interpreters](programming-languages-and-compilers-interpreters.md)
* [Machine learning](machine-learning.md)
